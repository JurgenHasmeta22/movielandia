## Getting Started: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you can start exploring the code, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to get MovieLandia24 running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version specified in `package.json`, ideally latest LTS)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Database server)

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JurgenHasmeta22/movielandia.git
    cd movielandia
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

3. **Environment Configuration:**

    - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the following environment variables to `.env.local`. You'll need to fill in the values based on your local setup and API keys.

        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
        NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:4000" # or your dev URL
        NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_secret_key" # Generate a secure secret
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
        RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key"
        POSTGRES_URL="your_postgresql_direct_connection_string"
        POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="your_postgresql_prisma_connection_string"
        POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL="your_postgresql_no_ssl_connection_string"
        POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="your_postgresql_non_pooling_connection_string"
        POSTGRES_HOST="your_postgresql_host"
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD="your_postgresql_password"
        POSTGRES_DATABASE="your_postgresql_database_name"
        ```

        **Note:** You'll need to set up a PostgreSQL database and obtain API keys for Google and Resend if you want to use those features. For development, you might use placeholder values or local PostgreSQL instance.

4. **Database Setup with Prisma:**

    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

    - `npx prisma generate`: Generates the Prisma Client based on your database schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`).
    - `npx prisma migrate dev`: Creates and applies database migrations to set up your database schema in your PostgreSQL database.

5. **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:4000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the application.

**Detailed Directory Breakdown:**

- **`src/`**: The heart of your application, containing all the source code.

    - **`actions/`**: This directory houses **Server Actions**. Server Actions are asynchronous functions that run on the server. They are used for data mutations (creating, updating, deleting data) and other server-side logic. Actions are organized by feature (e.g., `actor.actions.ts`, `auth.actions.ts`).
    - **`app/`**: This is the directory for the **Next.js App Router**. It uses a file-system based routing system.
        - **`(admin)/`**: This is a **Route Group** named `admin`. Route groups help organize routes without affecting the URL structure. This group contains all routes related to the admin dashboard, like `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/users`, etc.
            - `layout.tsx`: Defines the layout for all admin dashboard pages. It includes components like `AdminLayout`, `Sidebar`, `TopBar`.

## Core Concepts Explained

This section delves deeper into the core concepts and technologies used in MovieLandia24.

### 1. Routing with Next.js App Router

MovieLandia24 utilizes the Next.js App Router, a powerful routing system built on React Server Components.

- **File-System Based Routing:** Next.js App Router uses the directory structure within the `src/app/` directory to define routes. Each folder becomes a URL path segment, and special files like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `route.ts` within these folders define the behavior of those routes.
- **Route Groups:** Folders enclosed in parentheses, like `(admin)` and `(root)`, are route groups. They help organize routes logically without affecting the URL path. For example, `src/app/(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx` creates the route `/admin/dashboard`.
- **`page.tsx`**: This file is used to define a publicly accessible route. It exports a React component that will be rendered when a user visits the corresponding URL. For example, `src/app/(root)/page.tsx` defines the homepage (`/`).
- **`layout.tsx`**: This file defines a layout that wraps around all `page.tsx` files within the same directory or nested directories. Layouts are used to share UI elements like headers, footers, and sidebars across multiple pages.
- **`route.ts`**: This file defines API routes. API routes are server-side endpoints that can handle backend logic, database interactions, and return JSON responses. They are located in the `src/app/api/` directory.
- **Dynamic Routes:** Folders enclosed in square brackets, like `[id]`, create dynamic route segments. These segments can capture URL parameters. For example, `src/app/(root)/movies/[movieId]/[movieTitle]/page.tsx` creates dynamic routes like `/movies/123/avengers-endgame`, where `movieId` is captured as a parameter.
- **Route Handlers:** Functions within `route.ts` (like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) handle different HTTP methods for API routes.
- **Middleware (`middleware.ts`):** Middleware is executed before any route handlers. It's used for authentication, authorization, and redirecting users based on conditions. In MovieLandia24, middleware is used to protect admin routes and user-specific routes.

**Example: Understanding the `src/app/(admin)/admin/users/[id]/page.tsx` route:**

- **`(admin)`:** This is part of the `admin` route group, so all routes within it will start with `/admin/`.
- **`admin/`:** This is a directory within the `admin` route group.
- **`users/`:** Another directory, creating the `/admin/users/` path segment.
- **`[id]/`:** This is a dynamic route segment, capturing a parameter named `id`. This means the route will match URLs like `/admin/users/1`, `/admin/users/456`, etc.
- **`page.tsx`:** This file defines the React component (`UserAdminPage`) that will be rendered for the route `/admin/users/[id]`, which displays the details of a specific user in the admin dashboard.

### 2. Data Fetching and Server Actions

MovieLandia24 heavily utilizes Next.js Server Actions and Server Components for data fetching and mutations.

- **Server Actions:** Functions marked with `"use server"` are Server Actions. They run on the server, allowing for secure and efficient data manipulation.

    - **Location:** Server Actions are defined in the `src/actions/` directory.
    - **Purpose:** They are used for:
        - Database interactions (using Prisma Client).
        - Data validation (using Zod).
        - Sending emails (using Resend).
        - Any server-side logic that should not be exposed to the client.
    - **Security:** Server Actions are secure because they run on the server and are not exposed to the client-side JavaScript. They prevent client-side code from directly accessing the database or sensitive backend logic.
    - **Usage in Components:** Server Actions can be called directly from React components, including Client Components, using `async` and `await`. Next.js handles the communication between the client and server to execute the action.

    **Example: `src/actions/movie.actions.ts` - `getMoviesWithFilters` Server Action:**

    ```typescript
    "use server";

    import { prisma } from "../../prisma/config/prisma";

    interface MovieModelParams {
        sortBy?: string;
        ascOrDesc?: string;
        perPage?: number;
        page?: number;
        title?: string | null;
    }

    export async function getMoviesWithFilters({
        sortBy,
        ascOrDesc,
        perPage = 12,
        page = 1,
        title,
    }: MovieModelParams): Promise<any | null> {
        const filters: any = {};
        const orderByObject: any = {};

        const skip = (page - 1) * perPage;
        const take = perPage;

        if (title) filters.title = { contains: title };

        orderByObject[sortBy || "title"] = ascOrDesc || "asc";

        const movies = await prisma.movie.findMany({
            where: filters,
            orderBy: orderByObject,
            skip,
            take,
        });

        const moviesCount = await prisma.movie.count({ where: filters });

        return { movies, count: moviesCount };
    }
    ```

    This Server Action fetches movies from the database with optional filters, sorting, and pagination parameters using Prisma Client. It's called from React components in `src/app/(root)/movies/page.tsx` and `src/app/(admin)/admin/movies/page.tsx`.

- **Data Fetching in Server Components:** Server Components, which are the default in the App Router, can directly fetch data on the server using `async/await` and `fetch` or database ORMs like Prisma. This improves performance by fetching data on the server and sending pre-rendered HTML to the client.

### 3. State Management with Zustand

MovieLandia24 uses Zustand for global state management.

- **Zustand Store (`src/store/store.ts`):** Zustand is a lightweight and unopinionated state management library. It uses hooks to define and access state. `store.ts` creates the global store using `create` from Zustand.
- **AppStoreState Interface (`src/types/IStore.ts`):** This interface defines the structure of the global state, including properties and setter functions.
- **Global State Properties:** The store in `store.ts` manages application-wide state, such as:
    - `isOpenSidebarAdmin`: Boolean to control the admin sidebar's open/closed state.
    - `isDrawerOpen`: Boolean for controlling mobile drawer state.
    - `isEditModeReview`: Boolean to track if a review is in edit mode.
- **Setter Functions:** The store also includes setter functions (like `setIsOpenSidebarAdmin`, `setIsDrawerOpen`, `setIsEditModeReview`) to update the state.
- **Using the Store in Components:** Components use the `useStore` hook to access and update the global state. For example, to check if the admin sidebar is open and to use the setter function:

    ```typescript jsx
    "use client";

    import { useStore } from "@/store/store";

    function MyComponent() {
        const { isOpenSidebarAdmin, setIsOpenSidebarAdmin } = useStore();

        return (
            <div>
                <p>Admin Sidebar Open: {isOpenSidebarAdmin ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
                <button onClick={() => setIsOpenSidebarAdmin(!isOpenSidebarAdmin)}>
                    Toggle Sidebar
                </button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

### 4. Authentication and Authorization with NextAuth.js

MovieLandia24 utilizes NextAuth.js for authentication and authorization.

- **NextAuth.js Configuration (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`):** This file configures NextAuth.js.
    - **Providers:** Defines authentication providers like Google OAuth and Credentials (email/password login).
    - **Adapter:** Uses `PrismaAdapter` to store user sessions and accounts in the PostgreSQL database using Prisma.
    - **Callbacks:** Defines callbacks for handling sign-in, JWT creation, and session management.
    - **Pages:** Specifies custom pages for sign-in and error handling.
- **Authentication Providers:**
    - **Google Provider:** Enables login using Google accounts.
    - **Credentials Provider:** Enables email/password login using a local database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** NextAuth.js uses JWTs to securely manage user sessions. JWTs are stored in cookies and are used to authenticate requests.
- **`middleware.ts` for Authorization:** Middleware is used to protect routes and ensure that only authenticated users or users with specific roles can access certain pages.
    - **Protected Routes:** Middleware checks user authentication status using `getToken` from `next-auth/jwt`.
    - **Role-Based Access Control:** Middleware checks the user's `role` from the JWT to authorize access to admin routes (e.g., `/admin`). Unauthenticated users or users without the "Admin" role are redirected to the login page.
- **`useSession` Hook:** The `useSession` hook from `next-auth/react` is used in React components to access the current user's session information (user details, authentication status).
- **`getServerSession` Function:** The `getServerSession` function is used on the server-side (Server Components and Server Actions) to access the session.

### 5. Database Interaction with Prisma ORM

MovieLandia24 uses Prisma ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

- **Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema/schema.prisma` and model files):** The Prisma schema defines the database models (tables), fields (columns), and relationships between them.
    - **Models:** Each model (e.g., `User`, `Movie`, `Actor`) represents a table in the database. The schema defines the fields, data types, and relationships for each model.
    - **Relations:** Prisma schema defines relationships between models (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many). For example, a `Movie` can have many `MovieReview`s (one-to-many relationship).
    - **Example: `prisma/schema/movie.prisma` model:**
        ```prisma
        model Movie {
          id                   Int                   @id @default(autoincrement())
          title                String                @default("")
          photoSrc             String                @default("")
          photoSrcProd         String                @default("")
          trailerSrc           String                @default("")
          duration             Int                   @default(100)
          ratingImdb           Float                 @default(5.0)
          dateAired            String                @default("11/12/2005")
          description          String                @default("")
          cast                 CastMovie[]
          crew                 CrewMovie[]
          genres               MovieGenre[]
          reviews              MovieReview[]
          usersWhoBookmarkedIt UserMovieFavorite[]
          usersWhoRatedIt      UserMovieRating[]
          upvoteMovieReviews   UpvoteMovieReview[]
          downvoteMovieReviews DownvoteMovieReview[]
        }
        ```
- **Prisma Client (`prisma/config/prisma.ts`):** The Prisma Client is a type-safe database client generated from the Prisma schema. It is used to perform database queries in your application code.
- **Prisma Migrations (`prisma/migrations/`):** Prisma Migrate is used to manage database schema changes. Migrations are generated and applied to keep the database schema in sync with the Prisma schema.
- **Prisma Client in Actions:** Server Actions in `src/actions/` directory use the Prisma Client to perform database operations (e.g., fetching movies, creating users, updating reviews).

    **Example: Prisma Client query in `src/actions/movie.actions.ts`:**

    ```typescript
    const movies = await prisma.movie.findMany({
        where: filters,
        orderBy: orderByObject,
        skip,
        take,
    });
    ```

    This code snippet uses the Prisma Client (`prisma.movie`) to find multiple movies from the database based on specified filters, ordering, and pagination.

### 6. Form Handling and Validation with React Hook Form and Zod

MovieLandia24 uses React Hook Form for form handling and Zod for validation.

- **React Hook Form (`react-hook-form`):** React Hook Form is a library for building performant and user-friendly forms in React.
    - **Hooks-Based API:** It uses React Hooks to manage form state, validation, and submission.
    - **Performance:** It optimizes re-renders by only re-rendering components that need to be updated, leading to better performance.
    - **Controller Component:** The `<Controller>` component is used to integrate React Hook Form with Material UI form fields.
- **Zod (`zod`):** Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

    - **Schema Definition:** Zod schemas are defined in `src/schemas/` directory (e.g., `src/schemas/auth.schema.ts`, `src/schemas/movie.schema.ts`). These schemas define the expected structure and validation rules for form data.
    - **Validation Resolver:** `zodResolver` from `@hookform/resolvers/zod` is used to integrate Zod schemas with React Hook Form. This allows React Hook Form to use Zod for form validation.
    - **Client-Side Validation:** Validation is performed on the client-side using React Hook Form and Zod, providing instant feedback to users.
    - **Server-Side Validation (in Actions):** Although not explicitly shown in the provided files, server-side validation using Zod can also be implemented in Server Actions for extra security and data integrity.

    **Example: LoginForm component (`src/app/(root)/(auth)/login/_components/LoginForm.tsx`) using React Hook Form and Zod:**

    ```typescript jsx
    import { useForm, Controller } from "react-hook-form";
    import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
    import { loginSchema } from "@/schemas/auth.schema";

    const LoginForm = () => {
        const {
            control,
            handleSubmit,
            formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
        } = useForm({
            resolver: zodResolver(loginSchema), // Zod schema for validation
            defaultValues: { email: "", password: "" },
            mode: "onChange",
        });

        // ... form submission logic using handleSubmit
        return (
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(handleSubmitLogin)}>
                {/* ... form fields using <Controller> and Material UI <TextField> */}
                <Controller
                    name="email"
                    control={control}
                    render={({ field }) => (
                        <TextField
                            {...field}
                            type="email"
                            error={!!errors.email} // Display error state based on Zod validation
                            helperText={errors.email?.message} // Display error message from Zod
                        />
                    )}
                />
                {/* ... password field similarly */}
                <Button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>Login</Button>
            </form>
        );
    };
    ```

### 7. Email System with React Email and Resend

MovieLandia24 uses React Email and Resend for handling email communications.

- **React Email (`react-email`):** React Email is a framework for creating beautiful emails using React components.
    - **Email Templates:** Email templates are defined as React components in the `emails/` directory (e.g., `emails/RegistrationEmail.tsx`, `emails/ResetPasswordEmail.tsx`, `emails/NewsletterEmail.tsx`). These components use components from `@react-email/components` to structure the email layout (Html, Body, Text, Button, etc.).
    - **JSX-based Email Design:** Email templates are written in JSX, making them easy to create and customize using familiar React patterns.
- **Resend (`resend`):** Resend is an email API service used to send transactional emails.

    - **Sending Emails from Server Actions:** Server Actions in `src/actions/auth.actions.ts` use the Resend API (via the `resend` client) to send emails (registration verification, password reset, newsletter subscription).
    - **Resend API Key:** The Resend API key is stored as an environment variable (`RESEND_API_KEY`) and used to authenticate requests to the Resend API.

    **Example: Registration Email Template (`emails/RegistrationEmail.tsx`):**

    ```typescript jsx
    import { Html, Head, Preview, Body, Container, Heading, Text, Button, Link, Section, Img } from "@react-email/components";

    interface RegistrationEmailProps {
        userName: string;
        email: string;
        token: string;
    }

    const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL;

    const RegistrationEmail: React.FC<RegistrationEmailProps> = ({ userName, email, token }) => {
        const verificationLink = `${baseUrl}/verify-register?token=${token}&email=${email}`;

        return (
            <Html>
                <Head />
                <Preview>Welcome to MovieLandia24! Verify your email to get started 🎬</Preview>
                <Body>
                    <Container>
                        <Section>
                            <Img src={`${baseUrl}/icons/movielandia24-logo.png`} alt="MovieLandia24 Logo" />
                        </Section>
                        <Heading>Welcome to MovieLandia24, {userName}!</Heading>
                        <Text>Thank you for joining our community...</Text>
                        <Button href={verificationLink}>Verify Your Email</Button>
                        <Text>If the button doesn't work, copy this link:</Text>
                        <Link href={verificationLink}>{verificationLink}</Link>
                        <Text>&copy; 2024 MovieLandia24. All rights reserved.</Text>
                    </Container>
                </Body>
            </Html>
        );
    };

    export default RegistrationEmail;
    ```

    **Example: Sending Registration Email from Server Action (`src/actions/auth.actions.ts`):**

    ```typescript
    import RegistrationEmail from "../../emails/RegistrationEmail";
    import { Resend } from "resend";

    const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

    export async function signUp(userData: IRegister): Promise<User | null | undefined> {
        // ... user registration logic ...

        await resend.emails.send({
            from: "MovieLandia24 <onboarding@resend.dev>",
            to: [email],
            subject: "Registration Verification - Movielandia24",
            react: RegistrationEmail({ userName, email, token: token.token }), // Using React Email component
        });

        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
    ```

### 8. UI Components and Styling with Material UI and Emotion

MovieLandia24 uses Material UI (MUI) for UI components and Emotion for styling.

- **Material UI (MUI):** MUI provides a rich set of pre-built, customizable React components that follow Material Design principles.
    - **Consistent UI:** MUI ensures a consistent and visually appealing user interface across the application.
    - **Components Library:** MovieLandia24 uses various MUI components like `Box`, `Typography`, `Button`, `TextField`, `Card`, `Table`, `Menu`, `Modal`, etc.
    - **Customization:** MUI components are highly customizable through props and theming.
- **Emotion:** Emotion is a CSS-in-JS library used with Material UI for styling components.

    - **Styled Components:** Emotion allows you to write CSS directly within your JavaScript/TypeScript components using `styled` function from `@emotion/styled`.
    - **Theme Integration:** Emotion seamlessly integrates with Material UI theme, allowing you to access theme variables (colors, typography, spacing) in your styles.
    - **Example: Styled Component in `src/components/root/cardItem/CardItem.tsx`:**

        ```typescript jsx
        import { styled } from "@mui/material/styles";
        import { motion } from "framer-motion";

        const CardMotion = styled(motion.div)(({ theme }) => ({ // Using styled from Emotion
            whileHover: { scale: 1.05 },
            transition: { duration: 0.2, ease: "easeInOut" },
            // ... other styles ...
        }));

        const CardItem: React.FC<ICardItemProps> = ({ data, type }: ICardItemProps) => {
            return (
                <CardMotion> {/* Using the styled component */}
                    {/* ... card content */}
                </CardMotion>
            );
        };
        ```

- **Theme Customization (`src/utils/theme/theme.tsx`):** The `theme.tsx` file defines a custom Material UI theme.
    - **Color Palette:** Defines custom color palettes (primary, secondary, accents, grey, etc.) using `createTheme` from `@mui/material/styles`.
    - **Typography:** Customizes typography settings (font family, font sizes, font weights).
    - **Components Styles:** Allows for global styling and customization of MUI components.
    - **Theme Provider (`src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`):** The `ThemeProvider` component from `@mui/material/styles` wraps the application and provides the defined theme to all components, making the custom theme available throughout the app.

### 9. Error Handling

MovieLandia24 implements error handling at different levels to provide a robust user experience.

- **`error.tsx` (Route-Specific Error Handling):** Error boundary components (like `src/app/(root)/error.tsx` and `src/app/(admin)/error.tsx`) are used to handle errors within specific route segments.
    - **Error Boundaries:** These components act as error boundaries for their respective route groups (`(root)` and `(admin)`). If an error occurs during rendering a component within their scope, the error boundary catches the error and renders a fallback UI (error page) instead of crashing the entire application.
    - **`reset` Function:** Error components receive a `reset` function as props, allowing users to attempt recovery from the error (e.g., by retrying the operation that caused the error).
- **`global-error.tsx` (Global Error Handling):** `src/app/global-error.tsx` is used for handling errors that occur outside of route-specific error boundaries, acting as a fallback for unhandled errors.
- **`not-found.tsx` (404 Handling):** `src/app/(root)/not-found.tsx` and `src/app/(root)/[...not-found]/page.tsx` handle 404 Not Found errors (when a user navigates to a non-existent route). They render a custom 404 page using the `notFound()` function from Next.js.

**Key API Routes:**

- **`src/app/api/route.ts`**: A basic API route for checking authentication status.
- **`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`**: The main API route for NextAuth.js, handling authentication requests (login, logout, session management).
- **`src/app/api/changePassword/route.ts`**: API route for handling password change requests (after password reset verification).
- **`src/app/api/genres/route.ts`**: API route for fetching genres data (used in the header for genre dropdown).
- **`src/app/api/notifications/route.ts`**: API route for fetching user notifications, with pagination.
- **`src/app/api/search/all/route.ts`**: API route for performing a global search across movies, series, actors, etc., based on a search term and filters.
- **`src/app/api/verifyRegister/route.ts`**: API route for verifying user registration emails using a verification token.
- **`src/app/api/verifyResetPassword/route.ts`**: API route for verifying password reset requests using a reset password token.

**Example: `src/app/api/genres/route.ts` API Route:**

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { prisma } from "../../../../prisma/config/prisma";

export const GET = async () => {
    try {
        const genres = await prisma.genre.findMany(); // Prisma Client query to fetch all genres

        if (genres) {
            return NextResponse.json(genres, { status: 200 }); // Return genres as JSON response
        }
    } catch (err) {
        return new NextResponse("Internal Server Error", { status: 500 }); // Handle errors
    }
};
```

This API route fetches all genres from the database using Prisma Client and returns them as a JSON response. It's used to populate the genre dropdown in the header navigation.

---

## Actions in Detail

## Schemas and Types

The `src/schemas/` and `src/types/` directories are crucial for type safety and data validation.

**`src/schemas/` Directory:**

- Contains Zod schemas for data validation. Each schema file (e.g., `actor.schema.ts`, `auth.schema.ts`, `movie.schema.ts`) defines the expected structure and validation rules for specific data types (like Actor, User, Movie).
- **Example: `src/schemas/movie.schema.ts`:**

    ```typescript
    import { z } from "zod";

    export const movieSchema = z.object({
        title: z.string().min(1, { message: "required" }),
        photoSrc: z.string().min(1, { message: "required" }),
        photoSrcProd: z.string().min(1, { message: "required" }),
        trailerSrc: z.string().min(1, { message: "required" }),
        duration: z.coerce.number().min(1, { message: "required" }),
        dateAired: z.string().min(1, { message: "required" }),
        ratingImdb: z.coerce.number().min(1, { message: "required" }),
        description: z.string().min(1, { message: "required" }),
    });
    ```

    This schema defines the validation rules for movie data:

    - `title`, `photoSrc`, `photoSrcProd`, `trailerSrc`, `description`, `dateAired`: String fields, required (minimum length 1).
    - `duration`, `ratingImdb`: Number fields, required (minimum value 1 for duration, minimum 1 for ratingImdb).
    - Zod's `min()` and `max()` methods are used to define validation constraints.
    - `z.coerce.number()` is used to coerce string inputs to numbers.

**`src/types/` Directory:**

- Contains TypeScript type definitions (interfaces and types) used across the project.
- **`IStore.ts`**: Defines the interface `AppStoreState` for the Zustand store, specifying the shape of the global state and setter functions.
- **`filterOperators.ts`**: Defines a type `FilterOperator` representing the possible filter operators (e.g., "equals", ">", "<", "contains") used in data fetching actions.
- **`next-auth.d.ts`**: A declaration file to extend NextAuth.js types. It extends the `Session` and `JWT` interfaces from `next-auth` to include custom properties like `id`, `userName`, and `role` in the session and JWT objects. This allows you to access these properties in your components and server-side code in a type-safe manner.

## Emails in Detail

The `emails/` directory contains React Email templates used for sending emails from MovieLandia24.

**Email Templates:**

- **`NewsletterEmail.tsx`**: Template for the newsletter subscription confirmation email.
- **`RegistrationEmail.tsx`**: Template for the registration verification email sent to new users.
- **`ResetPasswordEmail.tsx`**: Template for the password reset email sent when a user requests to reset their password.

**Common Email Template Structure:**

Each email template is a React component that uses components from `@react-email/components` to define the email structure and content.

- **`<Html>`, `<Head>`, `<Body>`:** Root components for the email structure (similar to HTML structure).
- **`<Preview>`:** Component for the email preview text (the text that appears in email clients before opening the email).
- **`<Container>`:** Component to wrap the email content within a container for styling.
- **`<Section>`:** Component for creating sections within the email layout.
- **`<Text>`, `<Heading>`:** Components for rendering text and headings.
- **`<Button>`, `<Link>`:** Components for rendering buttons and links.
- **`<Img>`:** Component for embedding images in emails.

**Example: `emails/RegistrationEmail.tsx` Template (Snippet):**

```typescript jsx
import { Html, Head, Preview, Body, Container, Heading, Text, Button, Link, Section, Img } from "@react-email/components";

interface RegistrationEmailProps {
    userName: string;
    email: string;
    token: string;
}

const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL;

const RegistrationEmail: React.FC<RegistrationEmailProps> = ({ userName, email, token }) => {
    const verificationLink = `${baseUrl}/verify-register?token=${token}&email=${email}`;

    return (
        <Html>
            <Head />
            <Preview>Welcome to MovieLandia24! Verify your email to get started 🎬</Preview>
            <Body>
                <Container>
                    <Section>
                        <Img src={`${baseUrl}/icons/movielandia24-logo.png`} alt="MovieLandia24" />
                    </Section>
                    <Heading>Welcome to MovieLandia24, {userName}!</Heading>
                    <Text>Thank you for joining our community...</Text>
                    <Button href={verificationLink}>Verify Your Email</Button>
                    {/* ... rest of the email content */}
                </Container>
            </Body>
        </Html>
    );
};
```

This template defines the structure and content of the registration verification email, including the logo, welcome message, verification button, and a fallback verification link.

## Performance and Security Considerations

MovieLandia24 is built with performance and security in mind, incorporating several techniques and features:

**Performance Improvements:**

- **`next/image` for Image Optimization:** The `next/image` component from Next.js is used for image optimization. It automatically optimizes images by resizing, compressing, and serving them in modern formats (like WebP) to reduce bundle size and improve page load times.
- **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically code-splits the application, meaning that only the code needed for a specific page or component is loaded initially. This reduces the initial bundle size and improves initial load performance.
- **Server Actions and Server Components:** Utilizing Server Actions and Server Components for data fetching and mutations offloads work to the server, reducing client-side JavaScript execution and improving frontend performance. Server Components also enable streaming and incremental rendering, further enhancing perceived performance.
- **Route Groups:** Next.js Route Groups help organize routes and can potentially improve build times and code organization.

**Security Features:**

- **JWT Authentication with NextAuth.js:** NextAuth.js uses JWTs for secure session management. JWTs are cryptographically signed and stored in HTTP-only cookies, protecting user sessions from tampering and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Secure Password Hashing with bcrypt:** User passwords are not stored in plain text. When users register, passwords are hashed using bcrypt, a strong password hashing algorithm, before being stored in the database. This prevents passwords from being stolen in case of a data breach.
- **Protected Routes with Middleware:** Middleware is used to protect admin and user-specific routes. It checks user authentication status and roles before allowing access, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive parts of the application.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** User roles (e.g., "User", "Admin") are used to implement role-based access control. Middleware checks user roles to ensure that only authorized users can access admin functionality.
- **Input Validation with Zod:** Zod is used for input validation on both the client-side and (potentially) server-side. Input validation helps prevent malicious data from being submitted to the backend and protects against vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Secure API Routes:** API routes are serverless functions, which inherently provide a level of security as they are not directly accessible from the client-side code. They interact with the database and backend logic securely.

## Expanding on Key Project Areas

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of MovieLandia24, let's delve deeper into specific areas of the codebase.

### 1. Prisma Schema and Database Models in Detail

The Prisma schema, located in `prisma/schema/`, is the blueprint for your database. It defines the structure of your data, including models, fields, data types, and relationships. Understanding the schema is essential for working with data in MovieLandia24.

**Key Concepts in Prisma Schema:**

- **Models:** Represent database tables. Each `model` block in the schema defines a table and its columns.
    - **Example: `User` Model (from `prisma/schema/user.prisma`):**
        ```prisma
        model User {
          id                      Int                     @id @default(autoincrement())
          userName                String
          email                   String                  @unique
          password                String?
          role                    String                  @default("User")
          bio                     String                  @default("")
          active                  Boolean                 @default(false)
          canResetPassword        Boolean                 @default(false)
          subscribed              Boolean                 @default(false)
          resetPassowrdTokens     ResetPasswordToken[]

          notificationsSent       Notification[]          @relation("NotificationSender")
        }
        ```
    - **Fields:** Properties within a model that represent columns in the database table.
        - `id Int @id @default(autoincrement())`: Defines an integer field named `id` as the primary key, automatically incremented.
        - `userName String`: A string field named `userName`.
        - `@unique`, `@default`, `@relation`: Attributes that define constraints, default values, and relationships.
    - **Data Types:** Prisma supports various data types like `Int`, `String`, `Boolean`, `DateTime`, `Float`, and relations to other models.
    - **Attributes:** Special keywords that define properties of fields and models.
        - `@id`: Marks a field as the primary key.
        - `@default(...)`: Sets a default value for a field. `autoincrement()` for auto-incrementing integers and `now()` for timestamps.
        - `@unique`: Enforces uniqueness constraint on a field.
        - `@relation(...)`: Defines relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
            - `fields: [...]`, `references: [...]`: Specify the fields that establish the relationship.
            - `onDelete: Cascade`, `onUpdate: Cascade`: Define cascade behavior for delete and update operations (e.g., when a User is deleted, cascade delete related reviews).
            - `name: "RelationName"`: Used to name relations, especially for bi-directional relationships to avoid ambiguity.
- **Relationships:** Define how models are connected to each other.
    - **One-to-Many:** Example: A `Serie` has many `Season`s. Represented by a list of `Season`s in the `Serie` model and a `serieId` field in the `Season` model with `@relation` attribute.
    - **Many-to-Many:** Example: `Movie`s and `Genre`s have a many-to-many relationship through the `MovieGenre` join table. Represented by relation fields on both `Movie` and `Genre` models and a separate `MovieGenre` model to manage the join table.
    - **One-to-One:** Example: `User` and `Avatar` have a one-to-one relationship. `Avatar` model has a `userId` field with `@unique` and `@relation` pointing back to `User`.

**Modifying the Schema:**

1.  **Edit `.prisma` files:** Modify the schema files in `prisma/schema/` to add, change, or remove models, fields, and relationships.
2.  **Generate Prisma Client:** Run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate the Prisma Client with the updated schema. This ensures your application code is in sync with the schema changes.
3.  **Create and Apply Migrations:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
    ```
    - Replace `<migration_name>` with a descriptive name for your migration.
    - Prisma Migrate will generate a new migration file in `prisma/migrations/` reflecting your schema changes and apply these changes to your database.

### 2. Deep Dive into the Action Layer

The Action layer (`src/actions/`) is crucial for server-side logic and data interactions. Let's explore its structure and functions in detail.

**Action Structure:**

- **File Organization:** Actions are typically grouped by feature or model (e.g., `actor.actions.ts`, `auth.actions.ts`, `movie.actions.ts`).
- **"use server" Directive:** Each action file starts with `"use server";` directive, marking all exported functions as Server Actions.
- **Asynchronous Functions:** Actions are asynchronous functions (`async function`) as they often involve database operations or external API calls, which are inherently asynchronous.
- **Parameters and Return Types:** Actions define parameters (inputs) and return types using TypeScript interfaces and types, ensuring type safety.
- **Database Interaction:** Actions use the Prisma Client (`prisma` instance imported from `../../prisma/config/prisma`) to interact with the database.
- **Validation:** Actions often include input validation using Zod schemas to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Error Handling:** Actions implement `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors during database operations or other server-side logic.
- **`revalidatePath`:** Actions often use `revalidatePath` from `next/cache` to revalidate Next.js cache for specific routes after data mutations, ensuring data consistency on the frontend.

**Example Action Breakdown: `src/actions/movie.actions.ts` - `addMovie` Action**

```typescript
"use server";

import { Movie, Prisma } from "@prisma/client";
import { prisma } from "../../prisma/config/prisma";

export async function addMovie(movieParam: Prisma.MovieCreateInput): Promise<Movie | null> {
    try {
        const movieCreated = await prisma.movie.create({
            // Prisma Client: create operation
            data: movieParam, // Data for the new movie from form submission
            include: { genres: { select: { genre: true } } }, // Include related genres in the result
        });

        if (movieCreated) {
            return movieCreated; // Return the newly created movie
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error creating movie:", error);
        return null; // Return null in case of error
    }

    return null; // Fallback return null
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`"use server";`**: Marks this function as a Server Action.
2.  **`async function addMovie(movieParam: Prisma.MovieCreateInput): Promise<Movie | null>`**:
    - Defines an asynchronous function named `addMovie`.
    - `movieParam: Prisma.MovieCreateInput`: Specifies the parameter type as `Prisma.MovieCreateInput`. This type is automatically generated by Prisma Client based on the `Movie` model in your schema and is designed for creating new `Movie` records.
    - `Promise<Movie | null>`: Specifies the return type as a Promise that resolves to either a `Movie` object or `null` (in case of failure).
3.  **`try...catch` Block:** Handles potential errors during database operation.
4.  **`const movieCreated = await prisma.movie.create({...})`**:
    - Uses Prisma Client's `prisma.movie.create` method to insert a new record into the `Movie` table.
    - `data: movieParam`: Provides the data for the new movie record, taken from the `movieParam` input.
    - `include: { genres: { select: { genre: true } } }`: Specifies to include related `genres` data in the result. This is an "eager loading" feature of Prisma, optimizing data retrieval.
5.  **`if (movieCreated) { return movieCreated; }`**: If the movie creation is successful, the newly created `Movie` object is returned.
6.  **`catch (error) { ... return null; }`**: If an error occurs during movie creation (e.g., database error, validation error), the error is logged to the console, and `null` is returned to indicate failure.
7.  **`return null;` (Fallback):** A fallback `return null;` outside the `try...catch` to ensure the function always returns `null` in case of unexpected code flow issues.

**Workflow of an Action:**

1.  **Component Interaction:** A React component (Client or Server Component) calls a Server Action (e.g., `addMovie` from a form submission in `AddMovieAdminPage.tsx`).
2.  **Request to Server:** Next.js sends a request to the server to execute the Server Action.
3.  **Server-Side Execution:** The Server Action runs on the server:
    - It receives the input data (e.g., `movieParam`).
    - It may perform validation using Zod.
    - It interacts with the database using Prisma Client (e.g., `prisma.movie.create`).
    - It may call other services or perform other server-side logic.
4.  **Response to Client:** The Server Action returns a result (e.g., the created `Movie` object or `null` in case of error).
5.  **Client-Side Handling:** The component that called the action handles the response.
    - On success, it may update the UI (e.g., redirect to the movie details page, display a success message).
    - On failure, it may display an error message to the user.

### 3. Components: Building Blocks of the UI

Components in MovieLandia24 are categorized into `admin/` and `root/`, reflecting the separation between the admin dashboard and the main user application.

**Key Component Types and Patterns:**

- **Page Components:** Located in `src/app/(admin)/` and `src/app/(root)/` directories. These components are entry points for routes and define the structure and content of individual pages.
- **Layout Components:** Located in `src/layouts/`. Layout components (`AdminLayout`, `MainLayout`) provide the overall structure and shared UI elements (header, sidebar, footer) for groups of pages.
- **Reusable UI Components (`src/components/root/` and `src/components/admin/`):** These are building blocks used to create the UI. They are designed to be modular, reusable, and customizable.

**Example Components Breakdown:**

- **`src/components/root/cardItem/CardItem.tsx`**:
    - **Purpose:** A versatile card component used to display information about movies, series, actors, etc., in a compact and visually appealing way. Used in lists, carousels, and search results.
    - **Props:**
        - `data`: Data for the card (Movie, Serie, Actor, etc.).
        - `type`: Type of content being displayed ("movie", "serie", "actor", etc.).
        - `path`: Optional path for navigation (e.g., "actors", "movies").
        - `isAutocomplete`: Boolean flag to differentiate style for autocomplete results.
    - **Features:**
        - Displays image, title, rating (IMDb, average), and a short description.
        - Implements bookmarking functionality (toggling bookmark status).
        - Uses `next/image` for optimized image loading.
        - Uses `motion.div` from Framer Motion for hover animations.
- **`src/components/admin/form/Form.tsx`**:
    - **Purpose:** A generic form component for admin CRUD operations. Designed to be reusable across different admin sections (users, movies, genres, etc.).
    - **Props:**
        - `defaultValues`: Initial values for the form fields.
        - `schema`: Zod schema for form validation.
        - `fields`: Configuration array defining form fields (label, name, type, options).
        - `actions`: Configuration array for form action buttons (Save, Delete, Reset).
        - `formRef`: Ref to access the form's reset function.
        - `onSubmit`: Callback function to handle form submission (Server Action call).
        - `onDataChange`: Optional callback to handle form data changes.
    - **Features:**
        - Dynamically renders form fields based on the `fields` configuration.
        - Uses React Hook Form for form state management and submission handling.
        - Uses Zod for client-side form validation.
        - Provides reusable action buttons (Save, Delete, Reset).
- **`src/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx`**:
    - **Purpose:** Provides the main layout for the admin dashboard. Wraps all admin pages.
    - **Components:**
        - `Sidebar`: The admin sidebar navigation menu.
        - `TopBar`: The top bar for the admin dashboard.
        - `<Grid container>`: Uses Material UI Grid for layout structure (sidebar on the left, content on the right).
    - **Functionality:**
        - Sets up the basic structure of admin pages, including sidebar and top bar.
        - Includes `NuqsAdapter` to enable URL query parameters state management within the layout.

### 4. Styling and Theme Customization

MovieLandia24 uses Material UI for UI components and Emotion for styling, allowing for a consistent and customizable design system.

- **Theme File (`src/utils/theme/theme.tsx`):** This file defines the custom Material UI theme using `createTheme` from `@mui/material/styles`.
    - **Color Palette (`palette`):** Defines the color scheme for the application, including primary, secondary, accent colors, background colors, text colors, and custom color palettes (`greyAccent`, `greenAccent`, `redAccent`, `blueAccent`).
    - **Typography (`typography`):** Customizes font sizes and font families for different typography variants (h1, h2, body1, body2, etc.).
    - **Component Style Overrides (`components`):** Allows for global customization of Material UI components' styles. For example, `MuiButton`, `MuiListItemButton`, `MuiIconButton`, `MuiTab` are customized to disable ripple effects for a cleaner UI.
    - **Color Schemes (`colorSchemes`):** Defines both light and dark color schemes, allowing for theme switching functionality.
    - **`responsiveFontSizes()`:** Wraps the theme to enable responsive font sizes, automatically adjusting font sizes based on screen size.
- **Theme Provider (`src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`):** The `MUIThemeProvider` component wraps the application in `_app.tsx` (or layout files in the App Router), making the defined theme available to all components through React Context.
- **Accessing Theme Variables in Components:** Components can access theme variables (colors, spacing, typography) using the `useTheme` hook from `@mui/material/styles`.

    **Example: Using theme colors in a component:**

    ```typescript jsx
    import { Box, Typography, useTheme } from "@mui/material";

    function MyStyledComponent() {
        const theme = useTheme(); // Accessing the theme

        return (
            <Box sx={{ backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.dark, padding: 2 }}> {/* Using theme.palette.primary.dark color */}
                <Typography variant="h6" color={theme.palette.primary.light}> {/* Using theme.palette.primary.light color */}
                    Styled Text
                </Typography>
            </Box>
        );
    }
    ```

- **Customizing Component Styles:** You can customize the styles of Material UI components using the `sx` prop, styled components with Emotion, or by overriding theme styles.
    - **`sx` Prop:** For quick, component-specific styling, use the `sx` prop, which accepts style objects.
    - **Styled Components (Emotion):** For more complex, reusable styles or when you need to access theme variables, use styled components created with `styled` from `@emotion/styled`.
    - **Theme Style Overrides:** To globally change the default styles of MUI components, use the `components` section of the theme object in `theme.tsx`.
