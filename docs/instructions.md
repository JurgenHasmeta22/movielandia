## Project codebase overview and tech-stack

The project, MovieLandia24 (or simply MovieLandia), is built with Next.js 15 and React 19 RC, leveraging MUI v6 with Emotion as its primary tech stack. The core codebase resides in the /src directory, which includes the app router and other essential components.

This platform is essentially a social media network, but specifically focused on cinema-related content. It offers a wide range of features tailored to the world of movies and series.

For example, users can explore and interact with lists of movies, series, actors, crew members, seasons, and episodes. Each item can also be viewed individually to access detailed information. Users can engage by bookmarking or removing bookmarks, writing reviews (with the option to include ratings if logged in), and upvoting or downvoting other users' reviews. Reviews can also be sorted based on different criteria. Additionally, users can watch trailers for movies, series, seasons, and episodes. The sorting feature is not limited to reviews—it’s also available when browsing lists of items.

The platform includes a search page, which is accessed after entering a query in the search bar. However, this feature requires some refinement to improve its functionality. There’s also a profile page where users can view their own activity and data, as well as the profiles of other users they follow (if the follow request has been accepted).

Authentication is implemented using the latest version of NextAuth, supporting Google sign-in, a verification step, and robust form validation. Global state management is handled with Zustand, which manages modal states, sidebar visibility, and other global elements.

Efforts have been made to adhere to Next.js best practices, particularly with React Server Components (RSC) and server actions, though there is still room for improvement. At this stage, the project does not include any testing, but this is planned for future development.

## Coding Instructions and Guidelines (Claude 3.5 Sonnet 20241022 Instructions)

- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- **Focus on actively managing and reducing complexity wherever possible. Complexity is the enemy.**
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just the conventional wisdom.
- Please respect my prettier preferences when you provide code.
- Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.
- Consider other possibilities to achieve the result, do not be limited by the prompt.
- Please ensure that you verify whether a package is already listed in the package.json file before suggesting its installation. Avoid making assumptions about what the user has installed. Always check the file first.
- Please do not get overexcited about changing code. We need to move methodically and in a focused manner.
- Focus on the specific task that we spoke about. Do not change code in places unrelated to the task unless we explicitly spoke about refactoring or improving code quality. We aim to create minimal and focused commits so that the codebase can move along in a controlled and organized manner.

### For any proposed change please do the following:

- Explain what was wrong before
- Explain why the change fixes the issue
- Explain what the new code does and what it does better
- Provide the code in a concise and readable manner
- Proactively suggest solutions we may not have considered—anticipate our needs.
- No need to mention your knowledge cutoff
- No need to disclose you're an AI
- Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.
- Please ALWAYS write out the entire code and do not abbreviate. Specifically do NOT put comments into the code like "# ... existing code ...".

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- When working with Types or Interfaces for an entity in the UI, always check the existing Prisma types and models in the schema files. Avoid creating new columns or entities unless they already exist in the database schema.
- When styling with Material UI, refer to the /utils/theme/theme.tsx file for colors and palettes. Ensure your changes align with the existing theme instead of introducing random colors that might not fit the project's design.
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use the sx prop for Material UI components instead of styled components or Emotion CSS syntax wherever feasible and appropriate. This keeps the styling consistent and aligned with the framework's best practices.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible, so basically use arrow functions instead of functions.
- Always use Material UI version 5 or above throughout the project. Avoid using any version below this, under any circumstances. Additionally, utilize the Emotion implementation with sx props for styling, as it is stable and reliable. Do not use Pigment CSS in any part of the project, as it is unstable and unsuitable.
- When making API calls, CRUD operations, or server actions involving the database, always check the relevant Prisma models beforehand. Ensure that your queries align with the database schema. Avoid introducing or referencing columns or entities that don’t exist, as this will result in incorrect queries and errors.
- Do not include comments in JSX files. Additionally, ensure that JSX elements are written without any empty lines in between. The same rule applies to other parts of the codebase—only add comments if absolutely necessary, and keep them minimal.
- Use the app/ directory with React Server Components (RSC) for improved performance and simplicity.
- Client components 'use client' directives use them sparingly and only in components requiring client-side rendering.
- Utilize Next.js Server Actions to handle server-side logic effectively without overloading client-side code, and use API routes only for GET data fetching only from client components.
- Embrace React Suspense and async components to optimize loading states and enhance user experience.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement robust error handling for all API calls and database queries. Validate inputs rigorously before sending them to the server.
- Favor type or interface declarations over inline types to improve readability
- Use Next.js Image for all images to leverage built-in optimization. Always provide meaningful alt text.
- Use the Next.js head API or the metadata export in the app directory to set SEO-friendly meta tags and titles dynamically.
- When dealing with large datasets (e.g., infinite scroll), combine MUI components with lazy loading techniques using Intersection Observers.
- Use Next.js route groups for organizing large codebases. For example, segregate admin and user routes use that as example.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client' unless it is absolutely needed with client components which has interactivity.
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
