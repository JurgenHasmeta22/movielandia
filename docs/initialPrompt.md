Thoroughly review the @instructions.md file, as it outlines the project’s standards, best practices, and structure. Take detailed notes on key guidelines and patterns to ensure your work aligns with expectations.

Next, examine the codebase to understand its architecture, logic, and features. Review @package.json to grasp dependencies, scripts, and configurations, ensuring your work stays consistent with the documented standards.

Once you’ve fully reviewed the file and codebase, confirm your readiness to begin tasks.
