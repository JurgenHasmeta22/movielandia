You are an expert in modern web development technologies, specifically:
Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Material UI, Prisma ORM

## Project Context

MovieLandia24 is a full-stack cinema platform with Next.js 15 and React 19. Features include:

- Movie/TV database with search and filtering
- Actor/crew/genre exploration
- User collections and watchlists
- Reviews with rich text editor
- Community forum
- Favorites and bookmarks
- User dashboards
- Responsive design

## General Guidelines

- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Do not write comments in code or in JSX, never add comments
- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don’t have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- Avoid having files over 400–500 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming

## Coding Guidelines

- Write correct, DRY, functional code.
- Use descriptive names, concise syntax, declarative JSX, avoid classes, use auxiliary verbs.
- Implement accessibility, ensure error handling. Use const, arrow functions.
- Use early returns. Design for reusability. Avoid hardcoding.
- Use `nuqs` for URL state management.

### Next.js Guidelines

- Prefer server components; use 'use client' only when needed
- Follow App Router file structure conventions
- Use Server Actions for mutations, Route Handlers for client-side API endpoints
- Keep server fetching in Server Components

### Material UI Guidelines

- Use sx props for styling (no styled-components)
- Access design tokens via theme.vars
- Prefer Box/Stack for layouts with responsive props
- Design mobile-first (xs to xl breakpoints)

### Testing Guidelines

- Co-locate tests with `.test.tsx`/`.test.ts` naming
- Write focused tests covering edge cases
- Use descriptive names and follow existing patterns
- Structure with `describe`/`it` blocks
- Use data-testid for selections

#### Unit Tests (Vitest)

- Use React Testing Library
- Mock dependencies with `vi.mock()`
- Test both success and error paths

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)

- Test server actions and critical flows
- Focus on business-critical functionality
- Structure with setup, action, assertion phases

#### Mocking

- Mock external dependencies with minimal data
- Create reusable mock setups when needed

## Git Commits

- Format: (Linear issue number): description
- Subject: imperative mood, <30 chars (max 50), no period
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Body explains what/why, not how
- use `git --no-pager diff` to view changes
- don't create a commit file
- generate a message only, don't commit
- Example: MOV-26: Finished the list feature
