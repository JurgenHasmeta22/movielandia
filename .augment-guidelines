## Project Context

MovieLandia24 is a full-stack cinema platform built with Next.js 15 and React 19. Users can browse movies and shows, write reviews and interact with others, create custom lists and favorites, and access admin features for content management.

## General Guidelines

- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Do not write comments in code or in JSX, never add comments
- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don’t have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- Avoid having files over 400–500 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming

## Coding Guidelines

- Write correct, DRY, functional code.
- Use descriptive names, concise syntax, declarative JSX, avoid classes, use auxiliary verbs.
- Implement accessibility, ensure error handling. Use const, arrow functions.
- Use early returns. Design for reusability. Avoid hardcoding.
- Use `nuqs` for URL state management.

### Next.js Guidelines

- Client Usage: Limit 'use client' to interactive needs only. Default to server components.
- File Structure: Follow App Router conventions. Group related files, align with routing.
- Data Mutations: Use Server Actions only. No API route handlers for mutations.
- Client Fetching: Use Route Handlers for REST API endpoints in Client Components, never use server actions for fetching in client components.
- Server Fetching: Use Server Actions in Server Components.

### Material UI Guidelines

- Styling: Use MUI's Emotion integration with sx props. No styled-components.
- Theme: Use theme.vars for tokens (colors, typography, spacing) via theme.tsx in utils folder.
- Layout: Use MUI Box/Stack not Grid never use that with responsive props and breakpoints.
- Responsive: Follow mobile-first, test xs to xl breakpoints (<600px to 1536px+).

### Testing Guidelines

#### General Testing Principles
- Co-locate tests with the code they test using `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` naming convention.
- Write comprehensive, high-quality tests that cover all component variants and edge cases.
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase (e.g., CardItem.test.tsx) for consistency.
- Prioritize testing utils folder first, then features utilities, then UI components.
- Keep tests simple, readable, and maintainable.
- Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested.

#### Unit and Integration Tests (Vitest)
- Use Vitest for unit and component testing with React Testing Library.
- Structure tests with `describe` blocks for logical grouping and `it` blocks for individual test cases.
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks for setup and cleanup.
- Mock dependencies using `vi.mock()` to isolate the code being tested.
- Test both success and error paths for comprehensive coverage.
- Use `vi.clearAllMocks()` between tests to ensure test isolation.
- Wrap components with necessary providers (e.g., ThemeProvider) in test renders.
- Use data-testid attributes for reliable component selection.
- Test all component variants (movie, serie, season, episode, actor, crew).

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
- Use Playwright for E2E testing, especially for server actions and full user flows.
- Prefer E2E tests over unit tests for server actions due to complex mock data requirements.
- Structure tests with clear setup, action, and assertion phases.
- Use page objects or component fixtures to abstract test logic.
- Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) as configured.
- Focus on critical user journeys and business-critical functionality.
- Use the baseURL configuration to avoid hardcoding URLs.

#### Mocking Best Practices
- Mock external dependencies and API calls to isolate the code being tested.
- Create reusable mock setup functions for common testing scenarios.
- Use vi.mock() for module-level mocking and vi.fn() for function-level mocking.
- Mock minimal data required for the test to pass - avoid excessive mock data.
- For complex data structures, create factory functions or fixtures.
- Mock window and browser APIs when testing browser-specific functionality.
