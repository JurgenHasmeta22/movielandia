Thoroughly review the @instructions.md file, as it outlines the project’s standards, best practices and my instructions to you. Analyze everything there to ensure your work aligns with expectations.

Next, examine the codebase to understand its architecture, logic, and features. Review @package.json to grasp dependencies, scripts, and configurations, ensuring your work stays consistent with the documented standards.

Once you’ve fully reviewed the file and codebase, then we start working.
